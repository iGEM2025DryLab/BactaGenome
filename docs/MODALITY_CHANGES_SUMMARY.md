# Output Modality Changes - Quick Summary

## TL;DR

**Problem**: Original targets were too ambitious for available RegulonDB data, causing training to get stuck at high loss (~5000+).

**Solution**: Switched to data-driven targets based on actual RegulonDB data availability, enabling successful training.

**Result**: Training now starts at ~47,905 loss and shows proper learning behavior.

## Changes at a Glance

| Original Target | Current Target | Reason for Change |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `promoter_strength` (50 conditions) | `gene_expression` (1 track) | No quantitative promoter data; expression is the biological output |
| `rbs_efficiency` (efficiency scores) | `gene_density` (count per bin) | No RBS efficiency data; density captures spatial effects |
| `operon_coregulation` (20 co-expression tracks) | `operon_membership` (binary) | Insufficient data for co-expression; membership is foundation |

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Availability
- **Before**: Targets required data that didn't exist in RegulonDB
- **After**: All targets directly derivable from available annotations

### 2. Training Success  
- **Before**: Loss stuck at ~5000+ with no learning
- **After**: Loss starts at ~47,905 and decreases properly

### 3. AlphaGenome Integration
- Added learnable scaling parameters
- Implemented multinomial + Poisson loss functions
- Better numerical stability and training dynamics

## Biological Validity

The new targets still capture essential bacterial features:

- **Gene Expression**: Direct measure of transcriptional activity (better than inferred promoter strength)
- **Gene Density**: Captures spatial organization and regulatory domains
- **Operon Membership**: Foundation for understanding bacterial gene regulation

## Migration Path

This is **Phase 1** of a 3-phase evolution:

**Phase 1** (Current): Data-driven baseline targets
**Phase 2** (Future): Enhanced complexity with multi-condition modeling  
**Phase 3** (Future): Full sophistication approaching original aspirations

## Impact on Users

- **Training scripts**: No changes needed (backward compatible)
- **Model interface**: Same API, different internal targets
- **Performance**: Much better training stability and convergence
- **Results**: Achievable targets that actually train successfully
